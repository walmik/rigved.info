Pipeline Tools
During my tenure, I developed Python/Qt pipeline tools that streamlined workflows for a 400+ headcount art department and outsource vendors, maintaining production stability even as the studio underwent Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023.

Scene Healer: Runs a gauntlet of checks for common issues in 3D working files and repairs them before exporting to the game engine.
Gameready Updater: Automated rigging and application of skin-weights for static meshes.
World Mapper: Assembles the in-game world map for Diablo IV in a nightly build using latest geo caches and UI art overlays.
Asset Manager: Serves working files, elements and exports for assets to the user’s workarea.
Jewelrydoer: Auto-fit and skin various jewelry
Furtuoso: 3D brush-based texture painting Maya plugin for producing combmaps in hair and fur shading.
Playblast264: Maya plugin based on H264 codec for quickly submitting playblasts to Shotgrid.

Federico Solmi
Jun 2021 - Dec 2022
I worked as a 3D Technical Artist for Federico Solmi, a Guggenheim Fellow and internationally exhibited multimedia artist known for satirical video installations critiquing power and political absurdity. His work has been featured at major institutions including the Venice Biennale, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, the Phillips Collection, and the Block Museum of Art.
AI Texture Generation
Federico’s studio has a tradition of painting texture maps for 3D assets by hand, using acrylic colors on 11x17in sheets, before scanning them for use in texture mapping. I trained a Low Rank Adaption Matrix (LoRA) using an image dataset composed of the best quality textures produced by his studio in the past, captioned appropriately for a Stable Diffusion model to learn new concepts while retaining knowledge of existing concepts.

By utilizing this LoRA I was able to generate final render quality texture maps at 4K resolution using only the UV layouts and base material assignments from Blender.

In addition to generating texture maps, I use the Stable Diffusion model to generate subtle variations of painted textures.

I built a custom Unity shader which accepts a 2D Texture Array as its albedo map, and cycles through columns of the map to create a flickering texture effect.

Multi-Modal 3D Asset Generation
In addition to traditional mesh authoring techniques I use TRELLIS, Microsoft’s open-weights 3D asset generation model, to produce mesh assets procedurally. I created a GUI Tool for others to utilize my workflow using their own reference material.

The Python-based workflow sends 2D reference images in a request to a locally running Trellis server, and saves the results to GLB files. A Blender template resource is copied to the user’s workarea along with an import script configured for one-click importing of the generated meshes into the Blender scene.

Concept Art
I use a combination of traditional drawing skills, posing assets in Blender and refining via in-painting using Stable Diffusion to rapidly iterate on concepts and variants for GATT.

Using Blender and the Grease Pencil tool allows me to test various camera angles; this process combines storyboard, animatic and block-in phases to allow the fastest translation from script to moving image.

I adapted Episode 1 of GATT into a web comic, using a combination of Stable Diffusion AI and traditional drawing skills to refine the visual aesthetic of the show. I trained a LoRA using several high-quality stills of the protagonist, Violet, to preserve the character’s resemblance across panel art.
