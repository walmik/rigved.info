## AI Texture Generation Pipeline

Federico's studio has a tradition of painting texture maps for 3D assets by hand, using acrylic colors on 11x17in sheets, before scanning them for use in texture mapping. I revolutionized this workflow by training a **Low Rank Adaptation Matrix (LoRA)** using an image dataset composed of the best quality textures produced by his studio.

### Technical Implementation

- **Custom LoRA Training:** Trained specialized LoRA models on studio's archive of hand-painted textures
- **Dataset Curation:** Organized and captioned hundreds of high-quality texture samples
- **Prompt Engineering:** Developed caption methodology to teach Stable Diffusion studio-specific artistic concepts
- **4K Resolution Output:** Achieved professional-grade texture resolution matching traditional workflow
- **Style Preservation:** Maintained the distinctive hand-painted aesthetic that defines Federico's work

### Workflow

1. **Input:** UV layouts and base material assignments from Blender
2. **AI Generation:** Stable Diffusion with custom LoRA generates texture variations
3. **Output:** Final render-quality 4K texture maps ready for production use

### Results & Impact

By utilizing this LoRA-enhanced pipeline, I was able to:
- Generate **final render quality texture maps at 4K resolution**
- Reduce texture production time from days to hours
- Maintain artistic consistency across large asset libraries
- Enable rapid iteration on texture variations
- Preserve the hand-painted aesthetic crucial to Federico's artistic vision

This dramatically accelerated the texture production pipeline while maintaining the distinctive style that defines Federico's work.

---

## Custom Unity Shader Development

### Flickering Texture Effect

I built a **custom Unity shader** which accepts a 2D Texture Array as its albedo map, and cycles through columns of the map to create a flickering texture effect.

**Technical Features:**
- Accepts texture arrays for dynamic variation
- Time-based column cycling
- Seamless transitions between texture states
- Performance-optimized for real-time rendering

**Artistic Purpose:**
- Adds subtle, organic variation to painted textures
- Creates visual interest without breaking art style
- Enhances cinematic quality of final renders
- Contributes to the overall surreal aesthetic

This shader became a key component of Federico's signature visual style, adding depth and movement to otherwise static textures.

---

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Machine Learning:** LoRA training, Stable Diffusion fine-tuning
- **AI Art Tools:** Automatic1111, ComfyUI, training pipelines
- **Dataset Engineering:** Image curation, captioning, preprocessing
- **Shader Programming:** Unity HLSL shader development
- **Pipeline Integration:** Seamless workflow between AI tools and production pipeline
- **Quality Control:** Maintaining artistic standards with AI-generated content

---

## Innovation Impact

This project demonstrated that AI/ML tools can enhance traditional art workflows without sacrificing artistic quality or vision. By training custom models on studio-specific content, we achieved:

- **Speed:** 10x faster texture production
- **Consistency:** Unified aesthetic across all assets
- **Flexibility:** Easy variation generation
- **Quality:** Indistinguishable from hand-painted textures

## GATT Comic - AI-Assisted Sequential Art

Adapted the full-length 3D animated pilot episode of GATT into a web comic format, leveraging AI tools to accelerate production while maintaining artistic quality and character consistency.

---

## Technical Approach

### LoRA Training for Character Consistency

One of the biggest challenges in AI-generated sequential art is maintaining consistent character appearance across panels. Traditional Stable Diffusion models struggle with character consistency.

**Solution:**
- Trained a custom **LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation)** matrix using high-quality rendered stills of Violet, the protagonist
- Dataset: 30+ carefully selected frames from Episode 1 showing various angles, expressions, and lighting
- Captioned with detailed descriptions to teach the model Violet's distinctive features
- Integrated LoRA with Stable Diffusion 1.5 for character-consistent generation

**Results:**
- Violet maintains recognizable appearance across 100+ comic panels
- Consistent facial features, hair style, and costume details
- Ability to generate new poses and expressions while preserving identity

---

## Hybrid Workflow

### AI Generation + Traditional Art

Rather than pure AI generation, I developed a hybrid workflow combining the speed of AI with the control of traditional art:

**Process:**
1. **Layout:** Rough panel composition and staging in Photoshop
2. **AI Generation:** Generate panel art using Stable Diffusion + Violet LoRA
3. **Refinement:** Digital painting and correction in Photoshop
4. **Inking/Details:** Hand-drawn details, line work, and corrections
5. **Lettering:** Comic dialogue and sound effects

**Benefits:**
- **Speed:** 10x faster than fully hand-drawn comic production
- **Quality:** Maintains artistic control and refinement
- **Consistency:** LoRA ensures character recognition
- **Flexibility:** Can quickly iterate on panel compositions

---

## AI Tools & Technologies

### Stable Diffusion Pipeline
- **Model:** Stable Diffusion 1.5 base model
- **LoRA:** Custom-trained Violet character LoRA (16-dim, 800 steps)
- **Sampling:** DPM++ 2M Karras, 30 steps, CFG 7.5
- **Resolution:** 768x768 base, upscaled to 1536x1536 for print quality
- **Control:** ControlNet for pose guidance when needed

### Training Specifications
- **Dataset Size:** 30 images (Violet renders from Episode 1)
- **Captioning:** Detailed BLIP + manual caption refinement
- **Training Time:** ~2 hours on RTX 3090
- **Regularization:** Used generic "sci-fi character" images to prevent overfitting

---

## Narrative Adaptation

### From Animation to Sequential Art

Adapting a 28-minute animated episode to comic format required significant storytelling adjustments:

**Challenges:**
- Condensing 28 minutes to ~100 comic pages
- Translating cinematic camera movement to static panels
- Preserving pacing and dramatic beats
- Maintaining voice acting performances through dialogue

**Solutions:**
- Strategic scene selection focusing on key plot beats
- Dynamic panel layouts to suggest movement and pacing
- Expressive character poses to convey emotion
- Careful dialogue editing to preserve character voice

---

## Art Direction

### Visual Style

The comic maintains GATT's distinctive aesthetic while adapting to the comic medium:

- **Color Palette:** Desaturated sci-fi palette with neon accents
- **Lighting:** High-contrast noir lighting maintaining the series' atmosphere
- **Panel Design:** Cinematic widescreen panels mixed with traditional grid layouts
- **Typography:** Custom sci-fi UI elements and minimal sound effects

---

## Publishing & Distribution

**Format:** Web Comic (vertical scroll format for mobile)
**Pages:** 100+ full-color pages
**Platform:** Hosted on personal site and social media
**Reading Time:** ~20 minutes

**Audience Reception:**
- Positive response to AI-assisted workflow transparency

### Storyboard
![Stills](/assets/img/portfolio/2-gatt-storyboard.gif)

Instead of a conventional 2d storyboard, I decided to use primitive geometry and basic camera placement in Unity itself to make a 3D storyboard. A 3D storyboard enabled me to “walk” the virtual space and come up with interesting angles and compositions, as well as make adjustments based on any feedback I received from my peers. Furthermore, by creating a 3D storyboard I had already completed most of the layout work I would need to do later on when assembling the scene.

### Script
After I had finalized my storyboard, I recorded myself reading the lines from the script so I could create a correctly timed 3D animatic. This pre-recording helped us discover points in the script that did not translate as intended onto the screen and thus helped us edit and finalize the script before any actual animation work began.
- [Script 1](/assets/img/portfolio/3-gatt-script-1.png)
- [Script 2](/assets/img/portfolio/3-gatt-script-2.png)
- [Script 3](/assets/img/portfolio/3-gatt-script-3.png)

### Character
This scene required one lead character, two supporting characters, and a host of background characters. This was also the order of precedence and level of detail that I decided on for these characters. 

![Storyboard](/assets/img/portfolio/4-gatt-wake-concept.png)
![Storyboard](/assets/img/portfolio/5-gatt-wake-modelling.png)

I used Adobe Fuse to get a base human and clothing mesh for each character, and then brought them into Blender for sculpting, re-texturing and rigging. I used the concept art I had produced for Wake in an earlier episode to sculpt his body and face. 

![Character](/assets/img/portfolio/6-gatt-wake-hair.png)
![Character](/assets/img/portfolio/7-gatt-wake-1.png)

Unlike the supporting and background characters, I took the additional step of painting Wake’s textures by hand, since these were the textures that would get the most amount of screentime and could not get away with being generic. For Wake’s hair, I painted an alpha map using a Wacom tablet so that I could give the illusion of hundreds of hair strands with just a few intersecting planes.

### Motion Capture

I worked with a motion capture technician in the Carnegie Mellon mocap lab over Zoom to produce most of the character animation I needed for this scene. I provided a breakdown of the gestures, timestamps and targeted characters to make this work, and we had a back and forth of enacting various motions over video call, trying out different ways of carrying out basic actions like picking up and throwing and object, until we arrived at movements that suited each character. Once the motion capture data was prepared, retargeting the motion across all the characters was a straightforward process using the Mecanim system in Unity.

#### List of actions

| TIMESTAMP | CHARACTER | ACTION                                                           |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0:15      | Freddy    | Try to open the porta potty door. It is locked.                  |
| 0:30      | Wake      | Sit inside the porta potty. Leaning against a wall. Fast asleep. |
| 0:45      | Wake      | Jostled awake from being dropped.                                |
| 0:52      | Wake      | Clumsily get up, open the porta potty door and walk out.         |
| 0:54      | Wake      | Fall out of the porta potty onto the floor.                      |
| 1:00      | Wake      | Clumsily get up and look down below.                             |
| 1:04      | Wake      | Pick up a bottle and throw it at someone below you.              |
| 1:14      | Wake      | Pick up another bottle and throw it at someone below you.        |
| 1:16      | Wake      | Throw a bottle to the right at someone below you.                |
| 1:18      | Jimmy     | Quickly move aside to dodge a bottle thrown at you               |
| x:xx      | Multiple  | Cheering, clapping, pumping fist, shouting, etc.                 |

### Facial Animation
![Animation](/assets/img/portfolio/8-gatt-face-capture.gif)

Believable, high-quality facial capture does not have to require anything beyond a webcam and some tracking software. I painted over 46 blue dots on key points on my face (using blue eyeliner!) and recorded footage of myself performing every dialogue in the scene. I then brought this footage into Blender and tracked all the blue dots on my face. Finally, I wrote a script that would generate a facial rig with 46 bones corresponding to the dots on my face, and then lock the movements of those bones to the movements of the tracked dots. Once this animation was baked down into keyframes, it could be played in real-time and the process of retargeting this animation to other rigs with the same bone structure and hierarchy was straightforward. I suspect that with a higher quality video camera and a ring light, I could produce film quality facial capture using this technique. 

### VFX
My goal with the effects in this scene was to minimize attracting the viewer’s attention to them. I prefer subtle effects that contribute to the scene rather than over the top effects that distract from it. 
![Animation](/assets/img/portfolio/9-gatt-bottle-shatter.gif)
The main technical effects challenge was creating glass bottles that would fall, shatter, and could be thrown convincingly by my main character. After I had created a base bottle mesh, I used a cell fracture modifier in Blender to generate several glass shards from the bottle, and added mesh colliders to each shard. Once I brought both a fractured and an unfractured bottle asset into Unity, I wrote a script on the unfractured bottle that would replace itself with the fractured bottle upon collision, as well as add a force pointing away from the collision point on each shard. As for throwing the bottles, I wrote a script that used 3D kinematics to calculate the force and direction required for a bottle to land at a certain target, and applied an initial force accordingly. 
Other tech challenges include the construction vehicle that lifts the portapotty, for which I created a trail renderer on the hook object, so it would look like it was suspended by a cable at all times. I also wrote inverse kinematics scripts for the hands and heads of all my characters, so they could convincingly interact with environment objects such as doors and bottles, as well as subtly orient their bodies so that they were looking at each other. 

### Production
In addition to design and animation, I am also the producer of GATT. I am in charge of coordinating up to 15 solo contributors at a time during production, all of which is done virtually. I make use of documents such as production schedules, voice acting schedules, asset lists and budgets to keep this production organized, and cherish the opportunity to be a leader that GATT provides me.

## About the Film

**Hearts Grow Fonder** is a 3D animated short film that explores the emotional landscape of growing up and dealing with physical separation from loved ones. Created in May 2018, the film uses a distinctive visual style featuring boxy, geometric characters reminiscent of Minecraft aesthetics to tell a deeply human story.

---

## Creative Vision

The film's power lies in its ability to evoke complex emotions through simple, stylized characters. Rather than pursuing photorealism, the minimalist character design creates a universal quality—these characters could be anyone, anywhere, experiencing the universal pain of distance and longing.

**Themes:**
- Growing up and emotional maturity
- Physical distance and emotional connection
- The bittersweet nature of relationships
- How absence shapes our understanding of love

---

## My Role

As the **director, animator, and storyteller** for this project, I was responsible for:

### Direction & Story
- Developed the narrative from concept to completion
- Crafted the emotional arc and pacing
- Made all creative decisions regarding tone and visual style

### Character Animation
- Animated all character performances
- Used limited character rigs to create emotionally resonant performances
- Focused on body language and timing to convey emotion

### Visual Design
- Created the distinctive boxy character aesthetic
- Designed environments and props
- Established the film's minimalist visual language

### Production
- Solo production with the exception of music composition
- Managed entire pipeline from pre-production to final delivery
- Collaborated with musician for original score

---

## Technical Approach

**Software & Tools:**
- **Animation & Modeling**: Blender
- **Rendering**: Blender

### Modelling
![Modelling](/assets/img/portfolio/12-ceres-wireframe-back.png)
While modelling Ceres I experimented with multiple triangle counts before settling around ~25k for the base body mesh. Our total budget for the character was around ~70k faces so this left me with plenty of room to make stylized hair, eyeballs, a staff, etc.

### Texturing
![Texturing](/assets/img/fullsize/ceres-staff.png)
The art style we were going for was stylized realism, looking to sources like Kena: Bridge of Spirits and How To Train Your Dragon for reference. I found the best way to get this kind of look was to produce hand-painted textures on my Wacom tablet. This was a welcome change of pace from the more procedural tools we were using for the environment and let me revisit lighting and shading fundamentals.

### Storyboarding
![Texturing](/assets/img/fullsize/ceres-storyboard.png)
When storyboarding this sequence, I had to keep track of several narrative ideas being contributed by my team members. I decided to go beyond the conventional linear panel-based storyboard format and instead create a two-dimensional storyboard with narrative phases. We would then go on to narrow down our choices in each phase to create a cohesive story.

### Animation
![Animation](/assets/img/portfolio/15-ceres-reference.png)
For reference I recorded myself in my garage, moving with the characteristics and mannerisms I wanted Ceres to have. I walked on my tiptoes to emulate the way deer legs work and get a natural sense of balance.

### Groom
![Fur](/assets/img/fullsize/ceres-fur.png)
This project was my first time working with Alembic files. I used Blender to author a strand-based fur Alembic that I was then able to bring into Unreal Engine 4.26 using the new Groom plug-ins.
